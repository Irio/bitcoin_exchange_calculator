# Bitcoin exchange calculator

Run `exchange.rb` with purchase amount as argument.

I will consider purchase of Bitcoins in Coinbase and selling them in Mercado Bitcoin.

```sh
$ ./exchange.rb 100
On 2014-04-05, the final amount would be 237.80294786177637.
On 2014-03-31, the final amount would be 254.52183208019213.
```
